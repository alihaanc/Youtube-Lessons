In this lesson, I introduce **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** — a powerful concept in modern CPU architecture that enables processing multiple pieces of data with a single instruction.  
I explain how SIMD boosts **data handling efficiency** and improves performance in tasks like **image processing, signal filtering, and mathematical computations**.  

To make the concept more tangible, I demonstrate a **simple image processing test** that visually shows the performance benefits of SIMD over scalar processing.  
This lesson is perfect for anyone looking to understand **parallel processing** in an easy-to-follow and practical way.
