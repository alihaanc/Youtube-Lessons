In this lesson, I introduce **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** — a powerful concept in modern CPU architecture that enables processing multiple pieces of data with a single instruction.  
I explain how SIMD boosts **data handling efficiency** and improves performance in tasks like **image processing, signal filtering, and mathematical computations**.  

To make the concept more tangible, I demonstrate a **simple image processing test** that visually shows the performance benefits of SIMD over scalar processing.  
This lesson is perfect for anyone looking to understand **parallel processing** in an easy-to-follow and practical way.

In this lesson, I dive deeper into **RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)** concepts, going beyond the basics and exploring more advanced topics essential for real-world embedded development.

We focus on:
- **Interrupt Handling:**  
  How RTOS manages hardware interrupts, interrupt service routines (ISRs), and the transition between ISR and task execution.  
  Best practices for keeping ISRs efficient and avoiding common pitfalls that can lead to priority inversion or missed deadlines.

- **Scheduling Algorithms:**  
  An in-depth look at the most commonly used RTOS scheduling techniques:  
  - **Round Robin Scheduling** for fair CPU time allocation.  
  - **Priority-Based Preemptive Scheduling** for deterministic real-time performance.  
  - **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** and **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** for periodic and time-critical tasks.  

Through code demonstrations, we analyze how different scheduling algorithms impact **task responsiveness**, **latency**, and **system stability**.  
By the end of the lesson, you will have a clear understanding of how to design an RTOS application that efficiently handles interrupts and schedules tasks to meet strict real-time requirements.
